# Compiler-for-nanoC
In a series of four assignments we intend to implement a compiler for a C-like language. To keep the problem tractable, we present a very small subset nanoC of C that is easy to manage and yet has most of the key flavours of C.
The implementation of the compiler for nanoC is split into 4 assignments as follows:

* **Assignment 3** : Lexical Analyzer for nanoC using Flex. The lexical grammar specification is given here.  
* **Assignment 4** : Parser for nanoC using Bison. The phase structure grammar specification is given in Assignment 3.  
* **Assignment 5** : Machine-Independent Code Generator for nanoC using syntax-directed translation with Bison. Three-Address (intermediate) Code (TAC) used as target of translation is explained here.  
* **Assignment 6** : Target Code Generator for nanoC by simple code generation by table lookup. The target processor is taken to be x86 and a subset of its assembly language is presented here for use.
